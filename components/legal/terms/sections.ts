Glamic Providers may, upon notice to Glamic, change the Fees. Changes in Fees are only applicable to Requests sent by a Glamic Member after the change in Fees is posted to the Site. If you wish to provide a tip to your Glamic Provider, you may do so at the time of your Treatment in cash or via the Site within 48 hours of your Treatment.",
      "Responsibility for Payment: Glamic Members will be invoiced and charged the applicable Fees promptly following the completion of the Treatment. Fees paid by you are final and non-refundable unless otherwise determined by the Glamic Provider. Upon the receipt of your invoice, you agree to pay to the Glamic Provider all amounts owed thereunder (including any Fees plus applicable taxes), whether or not you dispute the amount of the charge or the quality or nature of the Treatment or Treatments provided. You agree that the third-party payment processor on our behalf may obtain a credit card authorization for your credit card on file with Glamic to cover the cost of Treatments at the moment your booking request is confirmed, and your card will be charged with the Fees, any other applicable fees, taxes, and tips as soon as Treatments are completed.",
      "Cancellation and Lateness: Glamic Members should provide as much advance cancellation notice as possible in connection with any Confirmed Appointments. Any cancellation of or lateness to a Confirmed Appointment will be subject to and addressed in accordance with the provider’s cancellation policy as outlined on the provider’s profile, the provider’s website, and in the booking confirmation.",
